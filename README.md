## Abstract
This paper presents a deep neural network approach to simulate the pressure of a mechanical ventilator. The traditional mechanical ventilator has a control pressure monitored by a medical practitioner, which could behave inaccurately by missing the proper pressure. This paper exploits recent studies and provides a simulator based on a deep sequence model to predict the airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the inspiratory phase of a breath given a time series of control parameters and lung attributes. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of neural network-based controllers in tracking pressure waveforms significantly better than the current industry standard and provides insights to build effective and robust pressure-controlled mechanical ventilators.
